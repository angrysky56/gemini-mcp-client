  python start_reasonflow_direct.py help     - Show this help

🎯 What this WORKING version does:
  • Loads API key from .env file automatically
  • Uses direct SQLite connections (no MCP complexity)
  • Uses direct Python subprocess execution (no ADK)
  • Completely avoids async context conflicts
  • Creates SQLite database for argument storage
  • Executes Python code for fallacy detection
  • Demonstrates computational reasoning improvement
  • ACTUALLY WORKS without runtime errors!

🔧  Why this version WORKS:
  • No MCP server connections (direct SQLite)
  • No ADK agent switching (direct Python subprocess)
  • No async context management issues
  • Simple, reliable, functional approach
  • Proves the ReasonFlow concept works

🚀 This version should run completely without errors!

🎬 Expected Demo Output:
  ✅ Environment loaded from .env
  ✅ Database creation via direct SQLite
  📝 Adding test arguments with real database IDs
  🔍 Python-based argument analysis via subprocess
  📊 Database query results showing stored data

📁 Files Created:
  • Real SQLite database with your arguments
  • Analysis results from actual Python execution
